🚀 FPGA-Based 8-Digit BCD Counter Project | Verilog HDL

I’ve successfully designed and implemented an 8-digit BCD counter (0 → 99,999,999) on FPGA using Verilog HDL.

🔹 Key Features:

⏱️ 6 Hz real-time counter derived from a 100 MHz clock

⏸️ Pause / Resume control using a switch

🔁 Automatic rollover after 99,999,999

➕ Manual increment buttons:
+10
+100
+1,000
+10,000

🔘 Reset functionality

🔢 8-digit multiplexed 7-segment display (no ghosting)

🧪 Fully verified with a time-accurate testbench (seconds-based simulation)

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
Clock division & timing control
BCD arithmetic and overflow handling
Button debouncing & edge detection
Display multiplexing
Hardware-safe Verilog coding practices
I’m open to feedback and suggestions.
